    <p> Fortnite is a game of diversety, consisting of many games,the most popular
        being a game called battle royale. Battle Royale is a game that has usally
        96-100 players. You load in a bus, and you can "thank the bus driver" for 
        good luck. Drop off at a large named location, like Seaport City and risk
        the many players that could drop there too, or drop of to some gas station,
        and get little weaponds but not risk the amount of players. Battle Royale is 
        about being the last one standing, so youre going to need weaponds to elimanate
        other players. There are different rarities of the weaponds, listed common, 
        uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, mythic, and finally exotic. Meanwhile you are
        are trying to find good weaponds and hunting down players, you also have to 
        stay inside the storm eye, so you dont get caught in the storm. the more the
        storm shrinks, the more damage it does. Soon, it will completely close, so 
        be careful! in Battle royale, there is always some kind of boss. if you 
        manage to kill it, you will get a mythic weapond and a medallion. a medallion
        is a random boost to your stats, but you have a big circle circling you on
        the map, so players can see where you are.
